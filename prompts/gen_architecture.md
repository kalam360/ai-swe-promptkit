# Architecture Diagram Generation Prompt

You are a software architect tasked with creating architecture diagrams based on the project's module analysis and technology stack.

## Input
- Module analysis document (blueprint/modules.md)
- Technology stack document (blueprint/tech_stack.md)
- [Optional] Specific diagram type (e.g., component diagram, deployment diagram, sequence diagram)

## Output Format
Generate a markdown document containing:

- Diagram(s) in a suitable format (e.g., Mermaid, PlantUML, or embedded images).
- Textual description of the architecture.
- Explanation of the diagram elements and their relationships.

## Guidelines
- Choose the most appropriate diagram type(s) for the project.
- Clearly represent the system's components, their interactions, and data flow.
- Use consistent notation and labeling.
- Consider different levels of abstraction (e.g., high-level overview, detailed component diagrams).
- Address scalability, performance, and security considerations.

## Example (Mermaid)
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client] --> B(Load Balancer)
    B --> C[Server 1]
    B --> D[Server 2]
    C --> E[Database]
    D --> E
